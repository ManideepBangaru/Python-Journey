""" Variable ==============================

n Python, variables are names that can be assigned a value and used
to reference that value throughout your code

Variable names are case-sensitive

Variables can contain uppercase, lowercase letters(A-Z , a-z) and digits(0-9) and
an under score, but cannot start with Zero"""

# Create a variable and print

word = "Hello"
print(word)

"""Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the
assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that
performs some operation on one or more values.


The most common way to write a comment is to begin a new line in
your code with the # character. When your code is run, any lines starting
with # are ignored. Comments that start on a new line are calledblock comments.

Python Variable Naming Conventions

In many programming languages, it is common to write variable
names in camelCase like numStudents and listOfNames. The first letter
of every word, except the first, is capitalized, and all other letters are
lowercase. The juxtaposition of lower-case and upper-case letters
look like humps on a camel


In Python, however, it is more common to write variable names in
snake case like num_students and list_of_names. Every letter is lower￾case,
and each word is separated by an underscoreIn Python, however, it is more common

How to Write a Comment=============================

The most common way to write a comment is to begin a new line in your code with
the # character. When your code is run, any lines start￾ing with # are ignored.
Comments that start on a new line are called block comments.

You can also write in-line comments, which are comments that ap￾pear on the same
line as some code. Just put a # at the end of the line
of code, followed by the text in your comment.
